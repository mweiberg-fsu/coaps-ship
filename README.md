# Flux Uncertainty Calculations and Visualizations
This directory contains the files to calculate flux uncertainties using the Monte Carlo Method. Input values are retrieved from 37 vessels through Erddap and stored by year in csv files.

## Project Overview
Generate uncertainty values for calculated latent and sensible heat fluxes, stress magnitude, and dimensionless obukhov as a potential future parameter.
